Tweak all the settings your firewire camera is capable of, open a connection and create a Syphon video stream out of it.

Apple's automagics are great most of the time but sometimes you need control over your camera's exposure or gain settings. 

> Currently only RGB8, MONO8, MONO16, YUV422 video modes are supported. If you need support for some other video modes or for Format7 get in touch opening an issue.

## System requirements

OSX 10.8 and later and any IIDC/DCAM-compliant Firewire camera (see the [compatibility list on dc1394's website](http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/cameras/)).

Tested cameras:
- AVT Guppy PRO F125B. 

Well, that's all.. If you test it on other cameras please [let me know](https://github.com/andreacremaschi/Syphon1394/issues/1) and I'll add it to this list.
